# What is MTHDS?

MTHDS (pronounced "methods") is an open standard for AI methods. It defines a typed language for describing what an AI should do — the data it works with, the transformations it performs, and how those transformations compose together — in plain text files that humans and machines can read.

An AI method in MTHDS is not code in the traditional sense. It is a declaration: "given this kind of input, produce that kind of output, using this approach." The runtime decides how to execute it. The method author decides what it means.

## The Two Pillars

MTHDS has two complementary halves, designed so you can start with one and add the other when you need it.

### Pillar 1 — The Language

The `.mthds` file format. Everything you need to define typed data and AI transformations in a single file.

A `.mthds` file is a valid [TOML](https://toml.io/) document with structure and meaning layered on top. If you know TOML, you already know the syntax. Inside a file, you define:

- **Concepts** — typed data declarations. A concept is a named type that describes a kind of data: a `ContractClause`, a `CandidateProfile`, a `Joke`. Concepts can have internal structure (fields with types like `text`, `integer`, `boolean`, `list`) or they can be simple semantic labels. Concepts can refine other concepts — `NonCompeteClause` refines `ContractClause`, meaning it can be used anywhere a `ContractClause` is expected.

- **Pipes** — typed transformations. A pipe declares its inputs (concepts), its output (a concept), and its type — what kind of work it does. MTHDS defines five **operators** (PipeLLM for language model generation, PipeFunc for Python functions, PipeImgGen for image generation, PipeExtract for document extraction, PipeCompose for templating and assembly) and four **controllers** (PipeSequence for sequential steps, PipeParallel for concurrent branches, PipeCondition for conditional routing, PipeBatch for mapping over lists).

- **Domains** — namespaces that organize concepts and pipes. A domain like `legal.contracts` tells you what a bundle is about and prevents naming collisions between unrelated definitions.

A single `.mthds` file — called a **bundle** — works on its own. No manifest, no package, no configuration. This is the starting point for learning and prototyping.

### Pillar 2 — The Package System

The infrastructure for distributing and composing methods at scale.

When a standalone bundle is not enough — when you want to share methods, depend on other people's work, or control which methods are public — you add a `METHODS.toml` manifest. This turns a directory of bundles into a **package**: a distributable unit with a globally unique address, semantic versioning, declared dependencies, and explicit exports.

Packages are stored in Git repositories. The package address (e.g., `github.com/acme/legal-tools`) doubles as the fetch location — no upload step, no proprietary hosting. A lock file (`methods.lock`) pins exact versions with SHA-256 integrity hashes for reproducible builds.

Cross-package references use the `->` syntax: `scoring_lib->scoring.compute_weighted_score` reads as "from the `scoring_lib` dependency, get `compute_weighted_score` in the `scoring` domain." The separator was chosen for readability by non-technical audiences — arrows are intuitive, visually distinct from dots, and universally understood.

## Core Concepts at a Glance

| Term | What it is | Analogy |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Concept** | A typed data declaration — the kinds of data that flow through pipes. | A form with typed fields. |
| **Pipe** | A typed transformation — declares inputs, output, and what kind of work it does. | A processing step in a workflow. |
| **Domain** | A namespace that groups related concepts and pipes. | A folder that organizes related definitions. |
| **Bundle** | A single `.mthds` file. The authoring unit. | A source file. |
| **Package** | A directory with a `METHODS.toml` manifest and one or more bundles. The distribution unit. | A versioned library. |

## A Concrete Example

Here is a complete, working `.mthds` file:

```toml
domain      = "joke_generation"
description = "Generating one-liner jokes from topics"
main_pipe   = "generate_jokes_from_topics"

[concept.Topic]
description = "A subject or theme that can be used as the basis for a joke."
refines     = "Text"

[concept.Joke]
description = "A humorous one-liner intended to make people laugh."
refines     = "Text"

[pipe.generate_jokes_from_topics]
type        = "PipeSequence"
description = "Generate 3 joke topics and create a joke for each"
output      = "Joke[]"
steps = [
    { pipe = "generate_topics", result = "topics" },
    { pipe = "batch_generate_jokes", result = "jokes" },
]

[pipe.generate_topics]
type        = "PipeLLM"
description = "Generate 3 distinct topics suitable for jokes"
output      = "Topic[3]"
prompt      = "Generate 3 distinct and varied topics for crafting one-liner jokes."

[pipe.batch_generate_jokes]
type             = "PipeBatch"
description      = "Generate a joke for each topic"
inputs           = { topics = "Topic[]" }
output           = "Joke[]"
branch_pipe_code = "generate_joke"
input_list_name  = "topics"
input_item_name  = "topic"

[pipe.generate_joke]
type        = "PipeLLM"
description = "Write a clever one-liner joke about the given topic"
inputs      = { topic = "Topic" }
output      = "Joke"
prompt      = "Write a clever one-liner joke about $topic. Be concise and witty."
```

This file defines two concepts (`Topic` and `Joke`, both refining the built-in `Text` type) and four pipes: a sequence that generates topics and then batch-processes them into jokes. It works as a standalone file — save it, point a runtime at it, and it runs.

## Progressive Enhancement

MTHDS is designed so you can start simple and add complexity only when you need it:

1. **Single file** — a `.mthds` bundle works on its own. No configuration, no manifest, no dependencies. Define concepts and pipes, and run them.

2. **Package** — add a `METHODS.toml` manifest to get a globally unique identity, version number, and visibility controls. Pipes become private by default; you choose what to export.

3. **Dependencies** — add a `[dependencies]` section to compose with other packages. Reference their concepts and pipes using the `->` syntax.

4. **Ecosystem** — publish packages to Git repositories. Registry indexes crawl and index them, enabling search by domain, by concept, or by typed pipe signature. The **Know-How Graph** — a typed network of AI methods — lets you ask "I have a `Document`, I need a `NonCompeteClause`" and find the pipes (or chains of pipes) that get you there.

Each layer builds on the previous one without breaking it. A standalone bundle that works today continues to work unchanged inside a package.

## What Makes MTHDS Different

MTHDS differs from other approaches to describing AI capabilities in three ways:

- **Typed signatures.** Every pipe declares the concepts it accepts and produces. This enables semantic discovery ("I have X, I need Y") and compile-time validation of data flow — something text-based descriptions cannot provide.

- **Composition built in.** Controllers (sequence, parallel, condition, batch) are part of the language, not an external orchestration layer. Multi-step methods are defined in the same file as the individual steps.

- **A real package system.** Versioned dependencies, lock files, visibility controls, cross-package references — the same infrastructure that makes code ecosystems work, applied to AI methods.

## Where to Go Next

- **Method authors**: Start with [The Language](../language/bundles.md) to learn bundles, concepts, pipes, and domains. Then move to [The Package System](../packages/structure.md) when you are ready to distribute.

- **Runtime implementers**: Start with the [Specification](../spec/mthds-format.md) for the normative reference on file formats, validation rules, and resolution algorithms.

- **Everyone**: [Write Your First Method](../getting-started/first-method.md) walks you through creating a working `.mthds` file step by step.
